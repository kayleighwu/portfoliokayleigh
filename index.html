        <p> <center> <strong>Why I Created My Portfolio Website</strong> </p>
        <p> My MBTI is ENFJ; pretty indicative of my love for planning. I've live by and
           for creating plans, then following them through. Early on at Tulane, I declared my major in neuroscience
           and proclaimed myself to be on the pre medical track,
           assuming a career in medicine was the only way to make a successful, yet meaningful
           impact in healthcare. I thought I had the rest of my life planned
           out and I was ecstatic by the sound of that. Flashforward, a few semesters and a few clinical internships
           later, I realized the career path I so perfectly planned out was not going to be fulfilling enough for me.
           As I unregretfully put my freshman year career aspirations to rest, it was time to explore other options.
            </p>
            <p> This January, I had the opportunity to attend the PLEN: Women in STEM Policy seminar in Washington D.C.
               PLEN brought together a network of motivated and talented women, from recent grads like myself
               to executive professionals who have already found their success within the industry. Through discussions,
               panels, and site visits, I was introduced to an incredible degree of career possibilities within STEM that
               I didn't even know existed. Listening to the experiences of these women, each
               encountering a different path with different obstacles, I felt inspired. The most salient message their stories taught
               me was that your career path, much like your life, cannot be completely planned for. There is
               no defined path and no one honestly knows exactly what their career will look like in the future.
               So rather than fixating on what you think your supposed to do, take a risk and focus on your true interests.</p>
               <p>
               At PLEN, I was especially fascinated to learn about work within both software design and engineering.
               In the days following the conference, I turned to my resources on google to attempt to learn how to code.
               I began creating this portfolio website to explore my interest in code design. Four days later,
               I've completed my final touches and am proud to share my work with you. I know I have a long way to go,
               but this is just the beginninng. I cannot wait to see what directions my life takes me in.
               I am unsure exactly of where I hope to end up with my career,
               but I am excited to explore my options, keeping
               in mind that the journey is just as important as the final destination.</p>

        <p> <center> I graduated from Tulane University in December 2019 with a B.S in neuroscience.
        At Tulane, I've found my best friends as well as my love for the New Orleans culture.
        In my four years, I was encouraged to become openly authentic and markedly more confident to be unaplogetically
        my own and true self.  </p>

        I met my best friends and formed connections I know will last a lifetime.
        This gave me the opportunity to do what I love, with the people I love,

        generous, giving me a space to learn and develop my technical lab skills, all the while
        generating in me a sense of belonging within the New Orleans community.
