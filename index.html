        <p> <center> <strong>Why I Created My Portfolio Website</strong> </p>

            <p> This January, I had the opportunity to attend the PLEN: Women in STEM Policy seminar in Washington D.C.
               PLEN brought together a network of motivated and talented women, from recent grads like myself
               to executive professionals who have already found their success within the industry. Through discussions,
               panels, and site visits, I was introduced to an incredible degree of career possibilities within STEM
               I didn't even know existed. Listening to the experiences of these women, each
               encountering a different path with different obstacles, I felt inspired. The most salient message their stories taught
               me was that your career path, much like your life, cannot be completely planned for. There is
               no defined path
               so rather than fixating on what you think your supposed to do, take a risk and focus on your true interests.</p>
               <p>
               At PLEN, I was especially fascinated to learn about work within both software design and engineering.
               In the days following the conference, I turned to my resources on google to learn the language of HTML.
               I began creating this portfolio website to explore my interest in code design. Four days later,
               I've completed my final touches and am proud to share my work with you. I know I have a long way to go,
               but this is just the beginninng. I cannot wait to see what directions my life takes me in.
               I am unsure of where I hope to end with my career,
               but I am excited to explore my options, keeping
               in mind that the journey is just as important as the final destination.</p>

        <p> <center> I graduated from Tulane University in December 2019 with a B.S in neuroscience.
        At Tulane, I was encouraged to become openly authentic and markedly more confident to be unaplogetically
       my own self. Here, I found my best friends as well as my love for the New Orleans culture.

        I met my best friends and formed connections I know will last a lifetime.
        This gave me the opportunity to do what I love, with the people I love,
        all the while cheering on the school I love! Roll Wave!

                  who shared with me her experience as well as resources within coding, I became fascinated
                  with this language. Within the next four days, I coded and completed
                  this website from scratch using HTML and CSS. And here we are.
